# Anti Pop/Crackle Script
Welcome traveler! Your arduous journey has led you here.

### Do you have the following issues?
1. Your earbuds or headphones make a **crackling, popping, or static sound** when **starting to play anything with audio**: video with audio, music
2. Your earbuds or headphones make a **crackling, popping, or static sound** after **not playing audio** for a few seconds
     
Guess what? This script may help stop the annoying sounds your headphones or earbuds may make! ðŸŽ‰ If you're interested, let's dive into my thinking process, or hop over to **Installation** to get started.
     
### Our Experiment
**Hypothesis**: Safari or MacOS automatically stops earbuds or headphones if no sound is being played, so the static sound could be electricity disconnecting from the earbuds or headphones    
**Prediction**: playing silent audio (yep) for an hour will stop the annoying sound     
**Experiment**: this rabbit hole led to this project (and also because I searched all over and couldn't find a script, app, or code that offered to stop this annoying popping sound, so hooray!)     

### Installation
1. Install [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) under releases (right side of screen while keep scrolling down)
2. Open the hammerspoon app
3. In menu bar icon of hammerspoon, press `open config`
4. Paste in the `init.lua` code from the popperstopper repository
5. Save the file [âŒ˜ + S]
6. In menu bar icon of hammerspoon, press `reload config`
7. Post any issues with the code if there are any in github issues
8. Enjoy the peace from the annoying crackling and popping sounds :D

### Running after installation
1. Open the hammerspoon app **before** you first play audio to prevent popping!

### Commands
1. CMD + SHIFT + 9 to quit script and hammerspoon
2. [wip, not ready yet] CMD + SHIFT + 8 to skip tutorial 

### Random notes
1. If I have time, I want to learn how to make this into an app to make it easier to use.
2. Lua is strangely similar to Javascript and I found it super fun (PKCTD Psychology negative reinforcement >:D )
