# Anti Pop/Crackle Script
### This may fix the following issues
1. Earbuds or headphones make a crackling, popping, or static sound when starting to play anything with audio: video with audio, music
2. Earbuds or headphones make a crackling, popping, or static sound after not playing audio for a few seconds

### Experiment
Hypothesis: Safari or MacOS automatically stops earbuds or headphones if no sound is being played, so the static sound could be electricity disconnecting from the earbuds or headphoens
Prediction: playing silent audio (yep) for an hour will stop the annoying sound
Experiment: this rabbit hole led to this project

### Installation
1. Install hammerspoon
2. Paste in the `init.lua` code 
3. In menu bar icon of hammerspoon, press reload config
4. Post any issues with the code if there are any in github issues
