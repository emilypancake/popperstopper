# Anti Pop/Crackle Script
### This may fix the following issues
1. Earbuds or headphones make a crackling, popping, or static sound when starting to play anything with audio: video with audio, music
2. Earbuds or headphones make a crackling, popping, or static sound after not playing audio for a few seconds    

### Experiment
**Hypothesis**: Safari or MacOS automatically stops earbuds or headphones if no sound is being played, so the static sound could be electricity disconnecting from the earbuds or headphones    
**Prediction**: playing silent audio (yep) for an hour will stop the annoying sound     
**Experiment**: this rabbit hole led to this project (and also because I searched all over and couldn't find a script, app, or code that offered to stop this annoying popping sound, so hooray!)     

### Installation
1. Install [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) under releases (right side of screen while keep scrolling down)
2. Open the hammerspoon app
3. In menu bar icon of hammerspoon, press `open config`
4. Paste in the `init.lua` code from the popperstopper repository
5. Save the file [âŒ˜ + S]
6. In menu bar icon of hammerspoon, press `reload config`
7. Post any issues with the code if there are any in github issues
8. Enjoy the peace from the annoying crackling and popping sounds :D

### Random notes
1. If I have time, I want to learn how to make this into an app to make it easier to use.
2. Lua is strangely similar to Javascript and I found it super fun (PKCTD Psychology negative reinforcement >:D )
